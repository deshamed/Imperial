## Downloading
1. Go to Releases.
2. Press where it says "Imperial.zip" (It should automatically download).
3. Save the file to wherever you want. (I recommend saving to Desktop for simplicity).
4. Extract the Zip file

## Installation
**NOTE: IMPERIAL ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS, MACOS AND LINUX AREN'T SUPPORTED**

You do not need to install tor. Tor is automatically installed when selected for proxies.

1. Open your extracted folder
2. Find the Imperial.exe file and run it
3. Enter in your custom fake link
4. Select how many threads (the more the faster but you will have a ton of retries).
5. Enter in your proxy txt file. (You can select "None" if you don't have a proxy)
6. You should get your custom fake link profile

(Its automatically generated with a fake username, avatar, display name, follower count, friends count, following count, and total RAP.)

## Usage
You are NOT allowed to sell Imperial or ANY modified versions. If you fork this and use it then give me credit.
